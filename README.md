### hello everyone 

i've received several emails in the last few weeks, so i wanted to make a note here that **i will not be updating any of my generative art repos**. 

please feel free to use the existing code however you like, but unfortunately i won't be able to help with anything. i am pursuing a career completely unrelated to tech and i want to leave most of the coding stuff behind me.

thank you! - anokhee
